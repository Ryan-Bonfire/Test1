# First File Header

qwerty


Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

~~~
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
~~~

Tables can look like this:

|size  |material      |color|
|----  |------------  |------------|
|9     |leather       |brown|
|10    |hemp canvas   |natural|
|11    |glass         |transparent|

**Table:** Shoes, their sizes, and what they're made of


SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|                |ASCII                          |HTML                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Single backticks|`'Isn't this fun?'`            |'Isn't this fun?'            |
|Quotes          |`"Isn't this fun?"`            |"Isn't this fun?"            |
|Dashes          |`-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash`|-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash|
